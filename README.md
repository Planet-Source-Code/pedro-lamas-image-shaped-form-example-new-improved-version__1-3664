## Image Shaped Form Example \(New Improved Version\)


</div>

### Description

Ever wanted to create a form with a shape defined by a picture? If so, this is what you have been looking for!

With this simple example, you will be able to use any standard image to define the shape of a form.

Along with the example, there is an ReadMe HTML file that explains how to create your own Image Shaped Forms!

This is a new, improved version of my previous upload, with come corrections for WinNT!
